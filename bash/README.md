What is this:
This repo is all about learning and exploring the wold of bash and powershell.

Why do this:
I'm looking to start a career in IT Cyber Security and learning these skills are vital to do so. 

Fundamental concepts I learned in Ops 201:
The basics of coding in BASH, navigating and using Visual Studio Code, using PowerShell and creating automated tasks.

Favorite Ops Challenge:
Ops Challenge 13 was my favorite, it was the first code that was more than one line, that I was able to quickly figure out and get to work without any assistance from others in my class or from an instructor.

How these can be applied to the workplace:
Automating tasks and generating reports will help save valuable time, such as automated back ups.

What scripts I'd continue to improve on:
If I had the time, would be the Ops 7 script, it was one of our more complex ones and one that I needed a lot of help on. I'd like to work on it and get it all on my own.

What aspect of shell scripting skillset I hope to improve next:
Honestly, all. But the biggest for me, is improving my understanding on how everything strings together and better understand how to use the brackets and when.
